## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

The objectives of this unsupervised machine learning project on the Titanic dataset are:

- To explore and prepare the Titanic dataset for clustering.
- To select meaningful numerical features: `Age`, `Fare`, `Pclass`, `SibSp`, and `Parch`.
- To handle missing values by removing incomplete rows.
- To standardize the feature values using `StandardScaler` for better clustering performance.
- To apply the **K-Means Clustering** algorithm:
  - Use the **Elbow Method** to determine the optimal number of clusters.
  - Group passengers based on similarities in selected features.
- To reduce dimensionality with **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)** for visualization:
  - Project the high-dimensional data into 2D.
- To visualize the resulting clusters using scatter plots with color-coded cluster labels.
- To gain insight into potential passenger groupings based on unsupervised patterns.
